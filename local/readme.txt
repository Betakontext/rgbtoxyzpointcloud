To run the program offline on a local server: 
Open the terminal and go to /local folder.
Install Node.js and check if node is installed:
bash: node -v

Start a local server to see the pointcloud: cd path\Directory
bash: node localserver.js
It is running if you see
http://localhost:3000/
Copy paste this url into the browser or ctrl click the link in the terminal
To close local server with press ctrl+c

-> Choose a *.jpg. I atm recommend to start with sth max 500kb, as the created *.json files to process the pointcloud can get quite big. 

Have fun!
